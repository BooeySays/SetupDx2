# SetupDx2
Sets up a seperate directory with its own bin, rc, backup directories. So when you install a new add-on or script, fired that need to be copied into a bin directory, it will get copied into the bin directory created by SetupDX2.
The system's file structure remains untouched, so if you need to get rid of SetupDX2, only the file copied into SetupDX2's directories willbe deleted - leaving all the original files untouched.
